# Triple Tic-Tac-Toe Variations

## A fun collection of three unique Tic-Tac-Toe games built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project is the result of my first 5-day JavaScript coding challenge, where I applied the concepts I learned over the past 5 days to create variations of the classic game. 

Tic-Tac-Toe is simple but offers plenty of room for creativity, so I experimented with variations that require new strategies, memory skills, and multi-layered thinking.

This helped me strengthen my DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic skills while keeping it fun.
